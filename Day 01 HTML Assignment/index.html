<h1>Welcome to My Assignment Project</h1>
<p>This assignment is done to test the knowledge I got from the first day of Full Stack cohort. In the first day we have learnt about which IDE we will be using in this cohort and we get started on the HTML.</p>
<p>That is the basic tags like heading, paragraph, audio, video, image, and anchor tags</p>
<p>We also learnt who to embed the video or twitter or even the instagram post into our website.</p>
<p>This has been the awesome session of HTML</p>
